## My Interest

I am a student of the Revealed Communication of God. I believe that the highest knowledge in this world is the knowledge of God and that knowledge is revealed in the major Divine Communications revealed to Moses, Jesus and Muhammad. I see Quran as the updated communication stream from God and a Book of God's Self-Disclosure. Only God can know God fully and in the Divinely Revealed Books like Torah, Gospel and Quran, God selectively reveals Himself suitable for human comprehension.

Due to problematic history of what happend immediately after the passing of the Prophet, true teachings were hijacked. Hence many important terms of the Qur'an was obscured and replaced with manipulative terms. I feel its important to re-trace the original meaning of terms like Salaat and Zakaat. The highly dubious hadith literature has done maximum damage than benefit. All it did was turned people away from the Qur'an. Hence its important that we do our due diligence as much as we can so that we can uphold the Qur'an and apply it practically in the best of our abilities. We can only do that by uncovering the true meaning of the Qur'an.

## Projects

At the moment I am engaged in a number of Quran Study related projects.

### Quran Answer

This is a project that aims to answer questions from Quran only. The questions that are provoked by the Quran itself and answered using Quranic Ayats only. I am putting together respository as I study the Quran and my first attempt is to do it in Bangla and then also have an English version. The project can be found at [Answer from the Quran](https://qurananswer.com)

### Salaat and Zakat

I am doing a study on understanding the exact meaning of Salaat and Zakat from the Quran.
