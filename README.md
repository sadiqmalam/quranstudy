## My Interest

I am stuent of the Revealed Communication of God. I believe that the highest knowledge in this world is the knowledge of God and that knowledge is revealed in the major Divine Communications revealed to Moses, Jesus and Muhammad. I see Quran as the updated communication stream from God and a Book of God's Self-Disclosure. Only God can know God fully and in the Divinely Revealed Books like Torah, Gospel and Quran, God selectively reveals Himself suitable for human comprehension.

## Projects

At the moment I am engaged in a number of projects.

### Quran Answer

This is a project that aims to answer questions from Quran only. The questions that are provoked by the Quran itself and answered using Quranic Ayats only. I am putting together respository as I study the Quran and my first attempt is to do it in Bangla and then also have an English version. The project can be found at [Answer from the Quran](https://qurananswer.com)
