## My Interest

I am stuent of the Revealed Communication of God. I believe that the highest knowledge in this world is the knowledge of God and that knowledge is revealed in the major Divine Communications revealed to Moses, Jesus and Muhammad. I see Quran as the updated communication stream from God and a Book of God's Self-Disclosure. Only God can know God fully and in the Divinely Revealed Books like Torah, Gospel and Quran, God selectively reveals Himself suitable for human comprehension.
